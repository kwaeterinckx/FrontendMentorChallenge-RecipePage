## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to organize my CSS more efficiently. I'm using custom properties and media-queries.  
This project also included some fonts. And instead of using the Google font option, I went for the @font-face.  
To avoid going up and down my CSS document, I created a seperate CSS file for my custom properties; fonts and media-queries.

I also learned to work with variable fonts.

### Continued development

I'll continue to focus on Flexboxes (Grids as well) and media-queries.  
Probably container-queries too since they offer more flexibility in responsiveness.

It was a very good challenge, even if it seems an easy layout challenge. There are various ways to solve this in CSS.  
I rewrote my code a couple of times before finding a correct solution to the responsiveness that was asked (desktop-mobile).  
And I'm proud of my *clean* code that resulted of my several attempts ðŸ¦š
